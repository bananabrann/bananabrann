Most of my work has been web development has been with [React](https://react.dev/), but I've dabbled in other tech, especially in my early career. Though it'd be *super awesome* if my work used this @bananabrann GitHub account, all my for-pay work has been on [Microsoft Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops) and is generally not available for viewing. For the past year or two at work, I've been building and maintaing core libraries in [Power Fx](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-Fx), and planning implmentations with senior members to make coding for all devs easy and fun ðŸŒ»

My hobby recently has been learning game development, and lately, I've come to really ejoy [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) with web projects.

I was born and raised in West Texas. After graduating high school, I enlisted in the [U.S. Marine Corps](https://www.marines.mil/). I traveled the world playing tuba, performing for foreign dignitaries and presidential audiences. The Marines gave me the launching pad for my life, and I would do it again in a heartbeat. However, staying for a career wasn't for me.

After leaving the Marines, I attended [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly) web development course (now called "Software Engineering Immersive"), a 3-month vocational coding school (bootcamp) in Washington, D.C. I studied my butt off, made two full-stack websites, built a robot named Debbie, and passed all my tests. From there, I was hired and started my journey as a software developer ðŸš¢
