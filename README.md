![aboutme](https://brannancloudstorage.blob.core.windows.net/github-readme/aboutme.png)

I was born and raised in the shrublands of West Texas. After graduating high school, I joined the [U.S. Marine Corps](https://www.marines.mil/). I traveled the world playing tuba, performing for foreign dignitaries and presidential audiences. The Marines gave me the launching pad for my life, and I would do it again in a heartbeat. However, staying for a career wasn't for me.

After leaving the Marines, I attended a web development school and later earned my B.S. in Software Engineering before joining the software engineering industry.

I still play tuba and baritone, and really love gardening and [aquascaping](https://www.google.com/search?q=aquascaping) 🌿
