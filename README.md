Most of my career has been web development with JavaScript, but I've dabbled in other tech, especially in my early career. Though it'd be *super awesome* if my work used this @bananabrann GitHub account, all of my for-pay code is generally not available for viewing. My work history includes everything from CLI apps in Java, Node.js websites with Express and React, to building and maintaining component libraries and Power Pages (think of it as "WordPress by Microsoft") with [Power Fx](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-Fx) and old school JavaScript/JQuery.

Recently, I've come to really love [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and Inertia.js with React for large projects, and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for small personal projects.

![aboutme](https://brannancloudstorage.blob.core.windows.net/github-readme/aboutme.png)

I was born and raised in the shrublands of West Texas. After graduating high school, I enlisted in the [U.S. Marine Corps](https://www.marines.mil/). I traveled the world playing tuba, performing for foreign dignitaries and presidential audiences. The Marines gave me the launching pad for my life, and I would do it again in a heartbeat. However, staying for a career wasn't for me.

After leaving the Marines, I attended a web development school and later earned my B.S. in Software Engineering before joining the software engineering industry.

I still play tuba and baritone, and really love gardening and [aquascaping](https://www.google.com/search?q=aquascaping) 🌿
