Most of my work has been web development has been with [React](https://react.dev/), but I've dabbled in other tech, especially in my early career. Though it'd be *super awesome* if my work used this @bananabrann GitHub account, all my for-pay work has been on [Microsoft Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops) and is generally not available for viewing. For the past year or two at work, I've been building and maintaining our core libraries with [Power Fx](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-Fx), and planning implementations with senior members to make coding for all devs easy and fun ðŸŒ»

My hobby is learning game development, and lately, I've come to really enjoy [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) with my web projects.

![aboutme](https://files.brannan.cloud/github-readme/aboutme.png)

I was born and raised in West Texas. After graduating high school, I enlisted in the [U.S. Marine Corps](https://www.marines.mil/). I traveled the world playing tuba, performing for foreign dignitaries and presidential audiences. The Marines gave me the launching pad for my life, and I would do it again in a heartbeat. However, staying for a career wasn't for me.

After leaving the Marines, I attended [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly) web development course (now called "Software Engineering Immersive"), a 3-month vocational coding school (bootcamp) in Washington, D.C. I studied my butt off, made two full-stack websites, built a robot named Debbie, and passed all my tests. From there, I was hired and started my journey as a software developer ðŸš¢
